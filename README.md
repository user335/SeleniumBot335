# SeleniumBot335
Source code for the bot used at twitch.tv/user335

# Requires VisualStudio + SpecFlow Extension to fully use - without the extension your .feature files will appear colorless
# Build the project and run tests from within test explorer in VS or launch with CLI (or just save the command to .bat and run that) using the following command:
# <pathToExe>\SpecRun.exe run <pathToDll>
# PathToExe: .\bin\Release\net471\SpecFlowPlusRunner\net461\specrun.exe or C:\Users\user\source\repos\PracticingSix\bin\Release\net471\SpecFlowPlusRunner\net461\specrun.exe
# run SpecRun.exe <- comes from specrunner nuget package and runs the tests for us (not available in .net 6 unfortunately)
# PathToDll: .\bin\Release\net471\SeleniumBot.dll or C:\Users\user\source\repos\PracticingSix\bin\Release\net471\SeleniumBot.dll
