# Requires VisualStudio + SpecFlow Extension to fully use - without the extension your .feature files will appear colorless
# Build the project and run tests from within test explorer in VS or launch with CLI (or just update the paths inside TiwtchBot.bat and run that) using the following command:
# <pathToExe>\SpecRun.exe run <pathToDll>
